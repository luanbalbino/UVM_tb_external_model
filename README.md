## Project Description - UVM_simple_DUT

The main purpose of this repository is to learning UVM to perform functional verification with Systemverilog.
The concepts are applied to implement and test a simple UVM testbench for a DUT (in this case, a simple four-input mux was chosen).
It's part of my studies with some courses on UVM and SystemVerilog.
